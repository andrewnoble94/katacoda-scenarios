Musketeer 1 - Make
Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds programs and runs commands via the same interface. Make is installed on all distros of Unix/Linux operating systems. It is also available on Windows operating systems as well. Make obtains all its knowledge of how to build the program from a file called the ```makefile```. This file contains ```targets``` that can be executed.
