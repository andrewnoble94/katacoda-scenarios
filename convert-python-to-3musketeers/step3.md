Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services (and their dependencies) from your configuration.  In 3 Musketeers, it also simplifies our Makefiles.

Our next task will be to add docker-compose. In order to do this we need a docker-compose.yml file. We will keep this file rather simple. If you open the docker-compose.yml file, you will see we have a service named ```printvars```. Under printvars we have a build section (which builds our dockerfile), an image section (which tags our image), anf finally an environment section (where we define the environment variables we would like to pass to the container).

## Task
Feel free to modify the docker-compose.yml file with any value for the ```DOG``` variable. After this lets run the command 
`docker-compose build`{{execute}}
### TIP The evnironment section is really useful when your container excepts multiple variables. The next iteration of the environment block is the use of an env file. Check out the course https://www.katacoda.com/james5101/scenarios/make-docker-compose-env-variables for more info on using an envfile with 3musketers. 

The command above will produce a newly built printvars image. Let's run the following command to confirm our image built. 
`docker images`{{execute}}

## Task
Let's try and run our image now via docker-compose up. Docker-compose up builds, (re)creates, starts and attaches containers for a service. You could also run ```docker-compose run servicename``` for one-off/adhoc tasks.  
`docker-compose up`{{execute}}

This wraps up the section on docker-compose. Docker-compose is very powerful for running containers, for more info visit https://docs.docker.com/compose/. 

Now, onto the last Musketeer, Make!
