Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developerâ€™s personal laptop. This gives developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from the rest of the applications and can be run anywhere.

## Task
Let's open the `Dockerfile`{{open}} and take a look at whats going on. It's a rather simple Dockerfile in that it simply:
1. Pulls down the openjdk base image
2. Copies our current directory into /app on the container
3. Sets a working dir to /app
4. Makes the gradle wrapper executable
5. Runs a few gradle tasks that generate a jar file
6. Moves that jar file
7. Finally, execute the jar file

## Task
Lets build it!
